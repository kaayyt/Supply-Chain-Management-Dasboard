## Project Overview

Supply chain analytics plays a critical role in data-driven decision-making across various industries, such as manufacturing, retail, healthcare, and logistics. This project focuses on analyzing and visualizing key aspects of the supply chain, enabling insights into product performance and supply chain efficiency. The analysis aims to streamline processes and improve data-driven decision-making.

The dataset is based on the supply chain of makeup products. Through this project, you'll explore a range of factors, from product performance to manufacturing efficiency, using interactive Tableau dashboards.

## Steps Followed in the Project

### 1. Data Collection and Preprocessing

- **Data Collection**: Gathered data related to supply chain metrics and product performance.
- **Data Preprocessing**: Utilized Python in Google Colab for cleaning and organizing the raw data, handling missing values, and transforming data types as necessary.
- **Data Export**: Saved the cleaned data as a CSV file for use in Tableau.

### 2. Data Preparation in Tableau

- **Connecting to Data Source**: Loaded the cleaned CSV file into Tableau Desktop for visualization and analysis.

### 3. Visualizations Created in Tableau

The following visualizations were created to provide insights into supply chain performance and product metrics:

- **Product Performance Dashboard**
  - Sales by Product Type: Bar chart showing sales volume for each product type.
  - Revenue by Product Type: Identifies which product types generate the highest revenue.
  - Stock Levels: Displays stock availability across product types.

- **Supply Chain Efficiency Dashboard**
  - Lead Times vs. Order Quantities: Scatter plot to assess correlations between lead times and order quantities.
  - Shipping Costs by Carrier: Compares shipping costs across different carriers.
  - Manufacturing Efficiency: Analyzes suppliers with lower manufacturing lead times and higher production volumes.

- **Customer Demographics Dashboard**
  - Revenue by Demographics: Displays revenue contribution by customer demographic segments to identify key customer groups.

### 4. Story Creation in Tableau

All the dashboards were combined into a cohesive **Tableau Story** for streamlined presentation and storytelling. This story highlights key insights, including product performance trends, supply chain efficiency metrics, and demographic-based revenue contributions.
